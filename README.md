Advanced Linear Models for Data Science 1: Least Squares.


This repository contains a few Jupyter notebooks with very simple R code. I had
to write this code to obtain the answers to some of the questions in the
quizzes. The notebooks you'll find in this repo are listed below:


* [One Parameter Regression Quiz](https://github.com/mwoitek/advanced-linear-models-1/blob/master/one_parameter_regression_quiz.ipynb)
* [Linear Regression Quiz](https://github.com/mwoitek/advanced-linear-models-1/blob/master/linear_regression_quiz.ipynb)
* [General Least Squares Quiz](https://github.com/mwoitek/advanced-linear-models-1/blob/master/general_least_squares_quiz.ipynb)
